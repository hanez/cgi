# xw3 CGI scripts

Note: All scripts are only working when the cgi-bin directory is beeing created using [Jekyll's Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) for setting the permalink and some scripts are using configuration vars from the project's _config.yml; E.g.: {{ site.data_dir }}.
